Wife and I stopped going here after our last visit a year ago. Waitress was snobby and inexperienced, food mediocre. Sent an email to location, never heard back. The 11695 Oracle rd  location was a recent new construction. Nicer atmosphere, cleaner, fresher food ie salads and fried items. Separate bar area. Outstanding service on 4 separate visits since coming here. Thank you. Jim","user_id":"AUIfv9YC3RW8GvC516qM3Q"}
