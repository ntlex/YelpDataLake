They had a limited menu but they said theyd have a full menu the next week so we'll definitely be stopping by again. We ordered the fish tacos which were pretty darn good, with pinto beans and poblano rice which was good but were pretty flavorless with very little seasoning. We also ordered the pozole which had turkey.. or lack there of, instead of pork. It Was also not in a chili powder broth, so it was more of a menudo, which also needed seasoning.","user_id":"-JMtMDC_iAyujCFOJP_M8g"}
